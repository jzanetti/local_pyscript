# Running Appplications in a standalone environment

# How to run our App:

### Step 1: Download the app to a desired local location

### Step 2: bring up a local host:
- In an `Windows` environment, bring up a terminal such as `Windows PowerShell`
- Go to the location where the app sits. For example, if the app located in `C:\\test\\app`. We need to go to that location by: `cd C:\\test\\app`
- Bring up a local host by `python python -m http.server 8080`


### Step 3: Go to a browser and type `localhost::8080`
