# Running Applications in a Standalone Environment

This document outlines the steps to run the application in a standalone environment, along with instructions for developers setting up their local development environment.

## üèÉ Running the Application 

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Step 1: Download/Copy the application to a local directory

Download the application files to your desired local directory. For example, you might choose `C:\test\app` on Windows or `/home/user/app` on Linux/macOS.

### üíª Step 2: Start the local host server

This application uses a simple local host for serving the files. Follow the instructions below for your operating system:

**Windows:**

1. Open `Windows PowerShell` or `Command Prompt`.
2. Navigate to the application directory using the `cd` command. For example: `cd C:\test\app`
3. Start the local web server: `python -m http.server 8080`

**Linux/macOS:**

1. Open a `terminal`.
2. Navigate to the application directory using the `cd` command. For example: `cd /home/user/app`
3. Start the local web server: `python3 -m http.server 8080` (Use `python3` if `python` defaults to Python 2)

### üåê Step 3: Access the application

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.  (Note the `http://` prefix and the single colon `:`). You should now be able to access the application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è For Developers

### Setting up the development environment

This project uses `conda` for environment management.  Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

1. **Install conda (if you haven't already):**  Download and install conda from [https://conda.io/](https://conda.io/).

2. **Create the environment:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory (where the `env.yml` file is located). Then, run the following command:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f env.yml
